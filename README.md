# Duplicate Files Scanner

#### Video Demo: ['Duplicate Files Scanner' in Python](https://youtu.be/0eR3o9thKVU)

#### Description:

The Duplicate Files Scanner is a simple Python program designed to assist users in identifying and managing duplicate files within a specified directory. The program prompts the user to provide a directory for scanning. It then analyzes the contents of the directory to identify duplicate files, categorizing them for easy reference. The duplicates are stored in a structured format, allowing users to take various actions, such as deletion or further analysis.

## Files Explanation:

1. **project.py**:
   - Contains the main() function and essential functions for executing the program.

2. **test_project.py**:
   - Houses test functions to validate the functionality of the functions in project.py.

3. **requirements.txt**:
   - Lists all necessary libraries that need to be installed using pip to run the project.

4. **backup_csv.csv**:
   - A CSV file storing information about the duplicate files found during the scan.

## Design Choices:

The Duplicate Files Scanner is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly. It employs a simple prompt-action approach, allowing users to provide the necessary input and receive clear, actionable results. The program does not rely on elaborate design patterns or complex algorithms, ensuring accessibility for users of varying technical backgrounds.

1. **Memory-Efficient Data Structure:** üöÄ
   - Embraced a list of lists of dictionaries, a lean and efficient choice for managing file information. This decision not only ensures optimal memory utilization but also sets the stage for potential scalability as the project evolves.

2. **Versatile File Handling:** üìÇ
   - Powered by Python's robust `open()` functionality, the project demonstrates remarkable adaptability in dealing with an extensive range of file types. This versatile approach lays the foundation for seamless integration with various file formats, enhancing the program's accessibility and utility.

3. **Precision in Duplicate Identification:** üîç
   - Engineered a meticulous duplicate identification process, combining both file type and content analysis. By scrutinizing these critical attributes, the program achieves surgical precision in identifying duplicates. This meticulous approach empowers users with accurate and reliable results, setting the Duplicate Files Scanner apart.

4. **Unique File Entries:** üìù
   - Infused each file entry with a distinctive "Entry no." identifier, a stroke of brilliance that simplifies file recognition. This intuitive naming convention, structured as <file number>C<duplicate number>, not only provides a clear identity but also lays the groundwork for potential future enhancements, ensuring a forward-looking design.

5. **Future-Ready Backup CSV Functionality:** üíæ
   - Anticipating the potential need for robust data management, the project includes a CSV-saving feature. While currently dormant, this functionality holds the promise of handling expansive datasets with ease. This forward-thinking design choice ensures the project's adaptability to future demands and underscores its scalability.

6. **Polite Permissions Prompt:** üõ°Ô∏è
   - Exhibiting a considerate touch, the program takes proactive measures to guide users. A polite prompt ensures that any open files are gracefully closed before initiating a scan. This precautionary step not only prevents potential errors but also guarantees a seamless user experience, reflecting the project's commitment to user-friendliness.

7. **Gentle Goodbye with KeyboardInterrupt:** üé©
   - In the event of user-initiated exits, the project responds with grace. Handling KeyboardInterrupt events elegantly, the program allows users to conclude their session effortlessly. This thoughtful design choice embodies a commitment to user convenience, ensuring that users can navigate the program with confidence and ease.

8. **Informative Scan Summaries:** üìä
   - Post-scan, users are treated to comprehensive summaries that provide valuable insights. These summaries offer a snapshot of the scan results, including key metrics such as the total number of files, duplicates, and potential space savings. This informative output empowers users with a clear understanding of the scan outcomes, promoting informed decision-making.

9. **Menu Magic for Seamless Navigation:** üé©
   - The program's interactive menu system stands as a testament to its adaptability and extensibility. Fueled by a dynamic list of options, the menu provides users with a structured and intuitive interface. This design choice not only enhances user engagement but also paves the way for future expansions, ensuring that the program remains versatile and accommodating.

10. **Cancel for Convenience:** üîÑ
    - Recognizing the value of user convenience, a 'cancel' lifeline is extended to users during directory selection. By simply entering the word 'cancel,' users can gracefully navigate back to the menu, providing a convenient exit strategy. This thoughtful addition streamlines user interactions, affirming the program's commitment to user-centric design.

11. **File Deletion, Swift and Secure:** üóëÔ∏è
    - When it comes to file deletion, the project opts for the reliable `os.remove()` method. This choice ensures precise and secure file removal, leaving no room for clutter. While currently focused on file deletion, future iterations may explore handling directories in tandem, showcasing the program's adaptability and potential for growth.

These meticulously crafted design choices collectively elevate the Duplicate Files Scanner, reflecting a commitment to efficiency, precision, and user satisfaction. Each choice, a stroke of brilliance, contributes to a seamless and empowering user experience. Bravo on a project well-designed! üåü
